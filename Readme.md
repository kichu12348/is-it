Point your camera at an object, select a question, and our advanced ML model will give you the definitive "YES!" or "NOPE!" you've been searching for.The Problem (that doesn't exist)Have you ever stared deep into your lunch, pondering the existential question, "Is this truly Biryani?". Have you ever wondered if that comfy-looking thing is, in fact, "sittable?". The uncertainty is maddening! Society has long been plagued by the inability to definitively categorize the mundane objects around us.The Solution (that nobody asked for)We built "is-it," a mobile application that eradicates these useless dilemmas. Using a sophisticated TensorFlow.js model integrated into a React Native app, we provide instant, confident answers. The app allows you to use your camera or gallery to select an image, choose from a list of profound questions, and receive an AI-generated verdict, restoring peace and certainty to your life.Technical DetailsTechnologies/Components UsedFor Software:Languages used: TypeScriptFrameworks used: React Native, ExpoLibraries used:@tensorflow/tfjs, @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native for on-device machine learning.expo-camera for live camera feed and controls.expo-image-picker to select images from the gallery.react-native-reanimated for smooth animations.expo-gl for WebGL backend for TensorFlow.js.Tools used: Expo CLI, EAS BuildFor Hardware:Not Applicable (This is a software-only project).ImplementationFor Software:Installation# Clone the repository

Project DocumentationFor Software:Screenshots (Add at least 3)The main app interface, showing the live camera view with controls for flash, camera toggle, and gallery access. The selected question is displayed at the top.The question selection sheet, where the user can choose from a list of predefined, useless questions to ask the AI.The results modal, displaying a confident "YES!" or "NOPE!" after the image analysis is complete, along with a cheeky confidence score.DiagramsThe user flow starts with the camera view. The user can take a picture or pick one from the gallery. This leads to a preview where they can confirm the analysis. The app then processes the image, runs it through the TensorFlow model, and displays the final "Yes/No" result in a modal, after which the user can try again.For Hardware: Not ApplicableProject DemoVideo[Add your demo video link here]The video demonstrates the full user journey: launching the app, selecting a question, taking a picture of an object, running the analysis, and viewing the final result. It also shows the gallery access and camera switching features.Team ContributionsMahadevan Reji: Led the integration of the TensorFlow.js model, developed the core prediction and image processing logic (src/brain/), and managed the application's state using React Context (src/context/AppContext.tsx).Neil Oommen Renni: Designed and implemented the user interface and component architecture, including the camera view, modals, and control elements (src/components/), and handled the overall UX and styling (src/components/styles.ts).Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è at TinkerHub Useless Projects
